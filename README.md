## Acknowledgements

The foundation of the Todo Application was built following guidance via the FreeCodeCamp Course [FARM Stack Course â€“ Full Stack Development with FastAPI, React MongoDB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWG7NlUDVaA&list=WL&index=5&t=3216s).
Additional code such as the Terraform, CI/CD workflows, and Kubernetes manifests, were developed by myself for additional learnings and practice.
